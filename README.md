The purpose of this repository is to provide interactive visualizations of the microbiota populations of the navel of several test subjects.

Use the dropdown menu under "Test Subject ID No." to cycle through the test subjects in order to view the data on their navel bacteria population.  The Demographic Info panel shows the subject's ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, and (weekly) washing frequency. A gauge for how often each test subject washes their navel is also displayed.
